In the [public profile](https://help.readymag.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026692531) section, you can specify a Home project. This feature can be helpful for large and complex portfolios, as well as company websites.

For example, say you set domain.com as your home project. Your projects will be mapped as domain.com/project1, domain.com/project2…, and so on. Their pages will be mapped as domain.com/project1/page1, and so on.

To set up a home project, map a domain to your profile page, then click ‘Select’ in the Home project field, and choose a project to use. 

Only one project in your account can be used as a home project.
