By default, the height and width of your screen determine the height and width of the published project. When the project is viewed on different screen sizes, it will be scaled automatically thanks to the Scale Layout feature. Read more about this feature [here](https://help.readymag.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053256071).

> Make sure to keep the browser zoom set to 100% when previewing the project, so you can see exactly how the project will look to your visitors.

If you need to place widgets outside of the visible layout area (this may be required for some animation scenarios), you can turn on the frame that will show the layout borders. To do so, click Grid and Layout → Guides. You will see a blue frame when zooming out your window.

You can also set the custom width for your layout by clicking on the default value ‘1024’ and entering a new value. 

## Guides

In Guides, you can set the desired number of columns and lines and their width and margins. 

## Grid

Move your cursor up and down, to set the desired values for the grid.

## Snap

If Snap is activated, a widget aligns automatically to the grid, guides, and nearby widgets when you move it.

## Sizes

Enable Sizes to see the height and width of all your widgets. Learn more about working with widgets [here](https://help.readymag.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020527072-Working-with-widgets).
