## Organizing pages in your project

The first icon on the left panel shows where you are in your project’s page count. Click on it to see a list of pages or to add a new page. You can also use the M [shortcut](/hc/en-us/articles/360020647532). 

From here, you can rearrange, duplicate, and delete pages. You can also access and edit [SEO settings](/hc/en-us/articles/360020844431) like title, description, keyword, and URLs.

Click on ‘Page title’ to modify titles or click ‘Custom URL’ to edit how the associated URL will appear to visitors. You can also create nested pages from here by dragging and dropping the desired page at the center of the previous page preview. 

Say you’ve built a portfolio under [myportfolio.com](http://myportfolio.com). There are also several categories for different projects that you’ve created for your clients, including one for non-profit organizations under the URL myportfolio.com/non-profit/. You can create separate pages for each of your non-commercial projects, then collect them under the category. Each page will have a related URL, like myportfolio.com/non-profit/project1, myportfolio.com/non-profit/project2, etc.

You can organize the transition between pages in a published project in two ways: 

1. Pages exist independently of each other. Your visitors switch between them using the horizontal navigation arrows (Preview —\> Settings —\> enable Navigation arrows) or using links created by you (e.g., via the navigation menu). This type of navigation is enabled in all projects by default.
2. Your visitors can scroll through pages vertically from the first to the last page. To turn on this type of navigation, go to Preview and enable Stack all pages vertically. You can also enable arrows for easier navigation (Preview —\> Settings —\> enable Navigation arrows) or add the Slide-in Transition effect (Preview —\> Settings —\> enable Slide-in Transition). With this effect, the page will slide out from under the previous page.
