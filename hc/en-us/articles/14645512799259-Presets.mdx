To access them, go to the Editor, click the + in the left dock (or use the W shortcut), and select Presets. You will see several categories with presets pre-built by the Readymag team. To add one of these presets, just click on it, and it will appear on all your layouts (desktop, mobile, and tablet).

You can also save your own presetsâ€”they will appear in the Saved folder. To do that, select a widget or several widgets at once and click Save to Presets in its attributes.

> Presets are not components. If you make any changes to your presets, you will need to add them to your projects again afterward.

Presets are fully tweakable, so you can modify them as you would normally with a regular widget or group of widgets. You can edit text, change color or tweak [animations](https://help.readymag.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020527292) so they better fit your design. Any modification will be applied to all layouts.
