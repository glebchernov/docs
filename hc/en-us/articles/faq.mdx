<Accordion title="Restrictions for customers based in OFAC-sanctioned countries">
Starting January 8, 2025, the Readymag Editor will no longer be accessible from IP addresses located [in OFAC-sanctioned countries, including Russia](https://readymag.com/readymag/terms-and-privacy/#:~:text=Please%20note%3A%20Readymag,ministries%20or%20agencies\).). This is an unavoidable measure, dictated by various sanctions and restrictions that prevent Readymag from guaranteeing uninterrupted service in certain regions. We apologize to all users who may be impacted.

**These restrictions include:**

\- Limiting access to the Readymag Editor (my.readymag.com/…) and all pages hosted on readymag.com, including the main page, examples, and related resources.

**These restrictions do not include:**

\- Access to projects with custom domains, which will remain available.
Note: Projects without custom domains (readymag.website/…) are blocked by Russian authorities and may be inaccessible through certain internet providers.

\- Terminating subscriptions or accounts with billing information associated with Russia.

<Accordion title="How to measure distance between widgets">
Open Grid & Layout and enable Snap and Sizes, or simply use the shortcuts: S (for Snap) and X (for Sizes). The distance between the two aligned widgets will now be shown. 

This feature is extremely helpful if you need to use multiple widgets with a constant distance between each instance (say, to create an image gallery). To do so, copy a widget with Option/Alt + Drag, set a distance between the original widget and its first copy, then repeat as many times as you need. The Sizes function will keep the distance between all copies equal.
