When you add a new widget, it appears in the Layers (Q) panel. You can freely move or resize them, alter their opacity, align and group multiple widgets together, or arrange them above or beneath each other. To move your widget around the page, click and drag it to a new position.

If you hover over a widget in the panel, two icons appear: an eye and a lock. The Eye makes your widget invisible, while the Lock allows you to pin it in place. You can also use the shortcut Shift+L to lock a widget. 

Click on the three dots icon next to Layers to perform one of these bulk actions with your widgets:

- **Show all.** See the list of all your widgets.
- **Show desktop widgets.** The widgets that are used in the desktop layout will be shown.
- **Show layers with links.** Only the widgets containing links will be shown. This is helpful if the structure of your project changes and you need to replace your links or fix the broken ones.
- **Remove unused.** This option lets you delete all widgets not used in any layout in one click. Use this option when you finish your project or notice that pages start working slowly when you edit them: removing the unused widgets will significantly improve the project’s performance both in the Editor and after publishing. This action can be performed from any layout (desktop, mobile, or tablet).

> If you accidentally delete the widgets you plan to use later, you can easily roll your project back to its last published version. To do so, click on Project settings, and select Restore to last published.

To see all widgets again, click three dots and select **Show all**.
